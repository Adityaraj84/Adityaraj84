-  Hi, Iâ€™m @Adityaraj84
   Dear reader, I want Share some basic **KEY WORD** related to **COMPUTER and DIGITAL WORLD**
   
   
  
- 1.# **COMPUTER** = "Commonly Operator Machine Particuler User Trade Education Research" its a full form COMPUTER. Computer is an Electronic machine it is a device that accept information and manipulates it for some result based on a program,software, or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed. 
-  2 **Generation of Computer** **Vacum Tube**= In first generation of computer we used vacum tube Technology.
                                      **Transister Technology** = In second generation of computer we used transister Technology.
                                       **Artificial Intelligence** = In this time we used **AI** .  AI is technology that enable computer and machine to simulate human learning, problem solving, creativity and autonomy.
- 3.**CPU** =(Central processing Unit) CPU is the brain of Computer.it is very important part of computer
- 5.**Input Device**= like mouse, key board,scanner,joystic etc.
-  6.**Output Device** = like speaker,monitor, printer,LCD etc.
-  7. **Memory** = mainly divided into two part 1.RAM(Random accesss Memory) 2. ROM(Read Only Memory)
-   8. **Storage** = storage can refer to the act of putting something in a specific place for future use e.g. HDD,SSD
-  9.**Software** = That we can't touch only can see is called software.it is a generic term for the instruction,program, and data tell a computer how to operate and perform specific tasks.
-  There are four type of software 1.** System software  2. Application Software  3. Programming software  4. Utility software**
-  10.  **Basic formula** **0,1 = 1 Bit
      -                     4 Bit = 1 Nibble
      -                     8 Bit = 1 Byte
       -                    1024 Byte = 1 KB
       -                    1024 KB = 1 MB
        -                    1024 MB = 1 GB
        -                   1024 GB = 1 TB
         -                   1024 TB = 1 PB
          -                  1024 PB = 1 ZB**

-**OPERATING SYSTEM** = The software that control the basic operation of a computer or computer Network. like Window,Mac OS and Android.

-**Network** = A network is basically a collection of Computers and other devices that are linked together to exchange data. Each device on the network is referred to as a node,
            and each node has its own address, which is anumerical value.
- **LAN(local Area Network)** = LAN is normally exclusiveto an organization, such as a school, office.
- **WAN(Wide Area Network)** = A Wide area nrtwork is the technlogy that connects your office, data centers, cloud application, and cloud storage together.
- **OSI Model**
              **L1 = physical**
              **L2 = Data Link**
              **L3 = Network**
              **L4 = Transport**
              **L5 = Session**
              **L6 = Presentation**
              **L7 = Application **
