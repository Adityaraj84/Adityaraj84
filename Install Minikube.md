## Minikube = 
Minikube is a tool that sets up a Kubernetes environment on a local PC or laptop. This tool provides an easy means of creating a local Kubernetes environment on any Linux, Mac, or Windows system, where you can experiment with and test Kubernetes deployments.

## Kubernetes(k8s)
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows developers to manage applications composed of multiple containers across a cluster of machines, providing features like load balancing, self-healing, and automated rollouts and rollbacks. Kubernetes is widely used to enhance the efficiency and reliability of deploying applications in cloud environments.

## Orchestration 
Orchestration is the automated coordination and management of complex tasks and processes, ensuring that different services and components work together effectively. In IT, it streamlines workflows and manages dependencies, especially in containerized environments.
## How to install minikube in dextop?
## Step 1: Set Up an AWS EC2 Instance
### 1.Log in to the AWS Management Console.
### 2.Launch an EC2 Instance:
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For simplicity, a basic Ubuntu Server AMI (like Ubuntu 20.04) works well.

Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro if you are using the free tier).

Configure security groups to allow SSH (port 22) and any other necessary ports (like 8443 for Kubernetes).

Launch the instance and download the key pair for SSH access.

## Step 2: SSH into Your EC2 Instance
$ Use the key pair to SSH into your instance:

**ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-public-dns
** 

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Once you're logged in, update the package manager and install required packages:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl wget apt-transport-https
## Step 4: Install Minikube
1. Download Minikube

curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
2. Install Minikube:

sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin/
## Step 5: Install a Virtualization Driver
Minikube requires a virtualization driver to run. Since AWS does not support KVM, you can use Docker as the driver.

### 1. Install Docker
sudo apt install -y docker.io

### 2. Start Docker and enable it to run at startup

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

### 3. Add your user to the Docker group:
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Log out and back in for this change to take effect.

## Step 6: Start Minikube
Now you can start Minikube using Docker as the driver:

minikube start --driver=docker
## Step 7: Verify Installation
### Check if Minikube is running:
minikube status

## Step 8: Accessing Kubernetes Dashboard (Optional)
You can also access the Kubernetes dashboard:

minikube dashboard

## Congratulations We achieved our Goal.
